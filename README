Neo-CMS = CodeIgniter + HMVC + groceryCRUD + Phil Sturgeon's Template
Neo-CMS already has perfect working user authorization and authentication.
Thus, you can focus only on your logic

You can make your own modules in modules directory

In CodeIgniter, you might load a view by using:
$this->load->view('some_view');

In Neo-CMS, you can do the same, but if you want the header, navigation menu etc also loaded,
you can use
$this->view('some_view');
If you want to pass some data, you can use:
$this->view('some_view', $data);

For Authorization sake, you can also add navigation and privilege parameter:
$this->view('some_view', $data, 'main_user', 'manage_cms');
That would means: Only user who can see main_user page and have manage_cms privilege will see some_view,
another user will see 404 not found

If you want to use grocery_crud feature, you can load view:
$this->view('grocery_CRUD', $output);

You can make your own template in template directory (please refer to default theme)
