Neo-CMS = CodeIgniter + HMVC + groceryCRUD + Phil Sturgeon's Template + My Own Logics
Neo-CMS already has perfect working user authorization and authentication.
Thus, you can focus only on your logic

Neo-CMS is CodeIgniter. This means that since you didn't install it, Neo-CMS is only CodeIgniter with some plugins added.

Once you've install Neo-CMS, you can still make any code just as in CodeIgniter.
Any code worked in CodeIgniter will also worked in Neo-CMS


You can make your own modules in modules directory

In CodeIgniter, your controller will extends CI_Controller:
class MyController extends CI_Controller{}

In Neo-CMS, you can still do the same, but it is recommended that your controller extends CMS_Controller:
class MyController extends CMS_Controller{}

In CodeIgniter, you might load a view by using:
$this->load->view('some_view');

In Neo-CMS, you can still do the same, but it is recommended to use this way:
$this->view('some_view');
If you want to pass some data, you can use:
$this->view('some_view', $data);

For Authorization sake, you can also add navigation and privilege parameter:
$this->view('some_view', $data, 'main_user', 'manage_cms');
That would means: Only user who can see main_user page and have manage_cms privilege will see some_view,
another user will see 404 not found

If you want to use grocery_crud feature, you can load view:
$this->view('grocery_CRUD', $output);

You can make your own template in template directory (please refer to default theme)

For your layout setting (headeer, slogan, etc) you can edit
application/config/cms.php <-- promise me you won't break anything :D
