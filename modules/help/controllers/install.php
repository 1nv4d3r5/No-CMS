The directory structure would be like this:<br />\n	<img src=\"modules/help/assets/images/modules_directory_structure.png\" style=\"float: left; margin: 10px; padding: 10px; \" /> Now, take a look at controllers directory.

You can gain some advantages by extend your model from CMS_Model instead of CI_Model. Some additional features such as get user name, user id, etc are already embedded in CMS_Model.

These segment is called \"partials\". \n	Bassically there are header, footer, left, right, navigation_path and content partial.\n	All of those partials except content are handled by No-CMS itself. \n</p>\n<p>\n	Making your costum themes is easy, but there are conventions that should be fullfilled.\n	What you need to do is to make a directory inside themes directory of your No-CMS. \n	So if you install No-CMS in <b>/var/www/No-CMS</b>,\n	the modules directory will be <b>/var/www/No-CMS/themes</b>.

Your client might also like to have ''admin'' and ''regular'' theme.\n				In the most simple case, only default.php is required. But depended on requirement, you might also like to write some additional templates.\n				<ul>\n					<li><b>default.php</b><br />This is the basic and should be exists layout.</li>\n					<li><b>mobile.php</b><br />This is the optional mobile layout. No-CMS uses user_agent to gain information about visitor''s device.\n						If the visitor uses mobile device (e.g: android smartphone), this layout will be activated.\n					</li>\n					<li><b>default_backend.php</b><br />This is the optional ''admin'' layout</li>\n					<li><b>mobile_backend.php</b><br />This is the optional ''admin'' layout for mobile user</li>\n				</ul>			\n			</li>\n			<li><b>partials</b><br />				\n				You should make some directory as much as your layout here.\n				For example, if you have default.php and mobile.php in the layouts directory, then you should also have\n				default and mobile sub-directories here. Each of those directories should consists of 5 files:				\n				<ul>\n					<li><b>header.php</b><br /></li>\n					<li><b>footer.php</b><br /></li>\n					<li><b>left.php</b><br /></li>\n					<li><b>right.php</b><br /></li>\n					<li><b>navigation_path.php</b><br /></li>\n				</ul>\n				Those files are consists of header, footer, left, right, and navigation_path partial respectively.				\n			</li>\n		</ul>\n	</li>\n	<li><b>assets</b><br /> This directory contains every static file that you want to use in your themes (e.g : javascript, css, images etc)</li>\n	<li><b>lib</b><br /> This directory contains of some additional \"logics\" to show the theme correctly</li>\n</ul>'),
